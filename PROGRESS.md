## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Accounts & keys** | 🟡 Partial | GitHub ✅, Supabase ❌ (dropped in P1), Anthropic ⬜ (P2), Railway ❌ (dropped — VPS), X/Meta ⬜ (P4) |
| **P1 — Spine + Reader** | ✅ **DEPLOYED** | Worker live on VPS, live ingest verified (50 items), public HTTPS pending final curl. See `docs/P1-HANDOFF.md`. |
| **P2a — Score & Inbox** | ✅ **Shipped** (branch `p2a-score-and-inbox`) | LLM router (`worker/app/llm/`: task-keyed routing, retry, fallback, repair-once), closed `ARCHETYPES`/`VERTICALS` taxonomy, `score_new` job every 15 min under advisory lock, scoring columns exposed on the Inbox with opt-in `order=score`. All 9 tasks complete and reviewed. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-p2a-score-and-inbox-design.md`, plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-20-p2a-score-and-inbox.md`. **No migration needed** — the columns were laid down in P1. **Debt:** `youtube.py` still calls Gemini/DeepSeek directly instead of through `llm/router.py`; retire at the end of P2b. |
| **P2b — Draft & Gate** | ⬜ Not started | Voice Pack, archetype-aware drafting, L1 regex gate, L2 cross-model judge. Needs a `voice_profile` migration: that table has `version`/`system_prompt`/`banned_phrases`/`example_posts` but **no name or key column**, so it models one voice. Two X profiles are wanted (Min Khooptong first-person, and a Lamka Labs masthead), selected per archetype. |
| **P2.5 — Newsletter + Funnel** | ⬜ Not started | |
| **P3 — Cockpit (GUI)** | 🟡 Built, unverified | Next.js in `gui/`. Pages: dashboard, `drafts`, `films`, `settings`, `docs`. Calls worker on `127.0.0.1:8000` (`/stories`, `/youtube/generate`, `/youtube/publish`, `/youtube/jobs`, `/config/voice_profiles`). Not yet run end-to-end against a live worker. |
| **P4 — Publishers** | ⬜ Not started | |
| **P5 — Reply engine** | ⬜ Not started | |
| **P6 — Analytics & hardening** | ⬜ Not started | |
| **YT P1/P2 — Scripting & Audio** | ✅ Completed | LLM Markdown scripts (Gemini) + ElevenLabs TTS integrated in Worker. |
| **YT P4 — YouTube API Upload** | ❌ Dropped | Uploads are manual. Publish path deleted 2026-08-06; see YT P5. |
| **YT P5 — Per-channel config** | ✅ **DEPLOYED** | Two channels (finance, kids) off one engine. Compliance floor as code constants. Every render ships `upload.txt` with title + SEO description. Migration 008 + channels config applied to local and VPS Postgres. Deployed to VPS 2026-08-06 (was stuck behind safe.directory). |
| **YT P6 — Research-first 3D Shorts** | 🟡 Live smoke complete; review/hardening open | `/films` makes the normal Short flow a 1080×1920 image-led 3D route. One Kids short rendered locally with its manual-upload packet on 2026-08-09. A second ComfyUI run was interrupted by a GPU thermal shutdown after narration, before image generation/render; it is not a draft. Migrations 009–010 add official feeds and enforce a 48-hour, dated-only fresh-news Inbox. |
| **CinePrompt — Studio Cinema page** | 🟡 Shipped, visual pass pending | `/cinema`: describe a scene → CinePrompt engine (`worker/app/cineprompt/`, 318 tests incl. golden fixtures) fills fields via LLM or manual category-grouped picker (8 sections, ~130 fields, multi-select) → build prompt → BYOK fal.run (Kling 2.0) generation → save + history. 4 worker routes (`/cineprompt/fill`, `/build`, `/save`, `/history`, `/vocab`), migration 011. Key never reaches the worker. Deferred: aesthetic/visual design pass, blocked on `frontend-design` skill needing a session restart to activate. |

## Deploy bugs (the full list — 9 found, all fixed)

| # | Bug | Fix landed in |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Supabase edge fn OOM-killed (`EarlyDrop`, 10MB ceiling) | New local embedder (`embedder/`, Option C) |
| D2 | Host Postgres on 5433 not 5432 (Timescale owns 5432) | All `psql`/`.env` use 5433 |
| D3 | DB password had `@` → URL parser broke (`failed to resolve host 'ssw0rd'`) | URL-safe password; runbook guidance updated |
| D4 | Migrations owned by `postgres` → `permission denied for table config` | GRANT block in `001_init.sql` |
| D5 | Lambda wrappers broke async-def invariant (`job 'poll_rss' fn is not async def`) | Explicit `async def` wrappers in `scheduler.py` + regression test |
| D6 | sentence-transformers treated model id as relative path (`PermissionError`) | `HF_HOME` pinned in `fce-embedder.service` |
| D7 | Deprecated `get_sentence_embedding_dimension` | `getattr` fallback to new `get_embedding_dimension` in `app.py` |
| D8 | Git credential mismatch (`khooptong-sudo` vs `khooptong-creator`) | User switched `gh` auth; not a code bug |
| D9 | `FCESupa DB PW.txt` accidentally committed | Scrubbed via `git commit --amend` pre-push; `.gitignore` hardened |

## Decisions log (cumulative — full list)

| # | Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 1 = v1.0 "Spine + Reader" only | brainstorm | Each phase independently verifiable |
| 2 | GUI Next.js (provisional, P3) | brainstorm | match PMS-portal muscle memory |
| 3 | Dry-run publisher (P4) | brainstorm | develop against a log; flip env for real publish |
| 4 | Model router config-driven | brainstorm | Kimi India access non-blocker |
| 5 | LE `active=false` in P1 | brainstorm | plumbing cheap, brain in P2 |
| 6 | `entity_type` on audit_log | brainstorm | `entity` alone is ambiguous |
| 7 | gte-small 384-dim in-DB | brainstorm | $0, no new API surface |
| 8 | RLS placeholder-uid | brainstorm | avoids config-table chicken-and-egg |
| 9 | `min_items_for_story=1` | brainstorm | a single strong item can seed a story |
| 10 | NSE via RSS, disabled if unavailable | brainstorm | NSE hostility makes scraping/CSV not worth P1 scope |
| 11 | Title-weighted embeddings | brainstorm | biggest lever on clustering precision |
| 12 | Keyword fallback ≥2 tokens | brainstorm | single-token = over-merge failure mode |
| 13 | Clustering separate from ingest | brainstorm | I/O-bound vs DB-bound; failure isolation |
| 14 | Re-embed via sweep, max 3 | brainstorm | failed embeddings recoverable, not permanent |
| 15 | Cluster link frozen after assignment | brainstorm | stability over theoretical optimality |
| 16 | Atomic story creation | brainstorm | orphan prevention |
| 17 | `/stats` orphan counter | brainstorm | count drops, not just survivors |
| 18 | Single replica + advisory locks | brainstorm | removes double-fire race at deploy layer |
| 19 | `coalesce` + `misfire_grace_time=60` | brainstorm | skip missed fires, run one catch-up |
| 20 | `/health` = process+scheduler+DB only | brainstorm | source health is `/stats`, not liveness |
| 21 | Two-tier config (env + config table) | brainstorm | secrets/structure vs tuning |
| 22 | All jobs `async def`, asserted at registration | brainstorm | AsyncIOExecutor runs coroutines; mixing is silent failure |
| 23 | FP ceiling ≤2 load-bearing, N-coupled | brainstorm | under-merge bias bounded absolutely |
| 24 | Frozen fixture + provenance assertion | brainstorm | deterministic tests; mismatch fails loud |
| 25 | 24h soak with closed-market stretch + forced retry | brainstorm | soak must exercise failure paths |
| 26 | Embedding inline in ingest | review | not a queue; `embed_retry` is failure-path only |
| 27 | `db_health` exempt from advisory lock | review | a probe needing the DB to acquire a lock fails for the wrong reason |
| 28 | `embed_retry_success` audit event | review | recovery provable after the fact |
| 29 | Auto-disabled-source check in soak | review | a source can die by auto-disabling and pass the gate invisibly |
| 30 | HNSW≈exact caveat documented in TUNING.md | review | threshold tuned in one engine, enforced in another |
| 31 | Clustering threshold 0.78 → **0.92** | build | gte-small's in-domain baseline cosine is ~0.79 |
| 32 | Self-host Postgres on VPS (Option C) | deploy | Supabase free tier pause + egress caps |
| 33 | Self-host embeddings on VPS (Option C) | deploy | Supabase hosted gte-small OOM-killed |
| 34 | Bare process, not Docker | deploy | systemd > Docker for one Python process |
| 35 | Worker on port 8002, embedder on 8001 | deploy | 5432/8000/443 owned by trading desk |
| 36 | Add Caddy vhost to `desk-caddy-1`, not a new Caddy | deploy | can't run two Caddys on 443 |
| 37 | Worker binds `0.0.0.0:8002` + ufw 22/80/443 only | deploy | Caddy reaches via Docker bridge; external blocked |
| 38 | Frame design local (Ollama `qwen2.5:7b`), story text cloud | youtube | model picks an archetype + fills slots, never writes HTML — a 7B is enough and quota stops being a failure mode |
| 39 | Archetype templates, not LLM-authored HTML | youtube | a pre-validated template cannot emit an invalid composition |
| 40 | `MIN_SCRIPT_FRAMES` alongside the ratio guards | youtube | ratios score a one-frame stub at 100%; a failed script was becoming a publishable draft |
| 41 | Script generation raises instead of falling back to a stub | youtube | there is no safe fabricated script; the caller must abort |
| 42 | Channels are a fixed pair in the `config` table, not a new table | channels | two channels; a table plus CRUD buys generality nothing needs |
| 43 | Compliance rules + base blocklist are code constants, not config | channels | in config they were one GUI edit from removal, with no trace |
| 44 | Effective blocklist is a **union**, not an override | channels | removing a base term becomes inexpressible rather than merely validated against |
| 45 | Uploads are manual; publish path deleted, not gated | channels | a dormant button hardcoding `selfDeclaredMadeForKids: False` is a live COPPA hazard |
| 46 | Metadata extracted at generation time, not publish time | channels | `_parse_storyboard_frontmatter` was only called from publish; deleting publish would have discarded the SEO description |
| 47 | Metadata validated **before** the render | channels | an empty description used to burn a full ffmpeg render before failing |
| 48 | Autopilot uses each story's own channel, skips those without one | channels | one env-var channel applied to every story would publish kids topics in the finance voice, on a daily timer |
| 49 | Image-led cinematic shorts are a separate backend, not an extension of low-poly Three.js films | youtube | character-led animated storytelling needs high-fidelity keyframes; the existing code-generated landscape film remains intact and its verification path is not weakened |
| 50 | fal.run generation stays entirely client-side (BYOK key never sent to the worker) | cineprompt | matches the original cineprompt.io architecture; zero new secret-handling surface on the backend |
| 51 | Vocabulary picker reuses `fields_in_scope(mode, level)`, the exact function Fill's system prompt already uses | cineprompt | one scoping rule, not two copies that can drift apart |
| 52 | `base.json` (vendor data) deduped defensively inside `values_for`, never hand-edited | cineprompt | the file's own docstring forbids hand edits; an internal duplicate is a vendor data-quality issue, not something to patch at the source |
| 53 | Final whole-branch review must execute code, not just read it | cineprompt | task-scoped review traced `build_prompt`'s "accepts a list" claim as written in the plan and passed it; only running it against every pickable field surfaced that ~23 merge-rule fields actually crash or silently corrupt output on a list input |
| 54 | P2 split into P2a (Score & Inbox) and P2b (Draft & Gate) | p2a | Decision #1 one level down: each half independently verifiable, and the router is proven against real stories before the gate is built on it |
| 55 | Router keys on task name, not model name | p2a | Callers stay ignorant of providers; re-routing is a config edit |
| 56 | Task-to-provider map in `config`, credentials in env | p2a | Decision #21's two-tier split applied to model routing |
| 57 | `ARCHETYPES` and `VERTICALS` are code constants, not config | p2a | Same reasoning as #43: in config they are one GUI edit from removal, with no git trace |
| 58 | Scoring does not mutate `stories.status` | p2a | `status` keeps one meaning; flipping it would silently empty the Inbox and break YouTube ideation |
| 59 | The practical-know-how vertical is named `practical_skills`, not `tips` | p2a | The vertical label reaches the drafting prompt in P2b, so the taxonomy word is a compliance surface |
| 60 | `investing_concept` separate from `personal_finance_concept` | p2a | Distinct editorial lanes; merging them loses a slice the owner asked for |
| 61 | Inbox ordering is a parameter, default unchanged | p2a | Changing the shared default would silently reorder the working video queue |
| 62 | Router raises on exhaustion; no fabricated score | p2a | #41 generalized from script generation to all LLM calls |
| 63 | Frontend hosting shelved; the GUI stays local-only until the pipeline is operational | product | A cockpit for absent functionality is the shop window before the shop. Also blocked in practice: any hosted frontend needs the worker publicly reachable, and `fce.lamkalabs.com` currently returns HTTP 525 |

## Cost reality (steady state, pre-revenue)

| Item | Monthly | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VPS | $0 marginal | already paying for the trading desk |
| Postgres | $0 | host Postgres, no cloud DB |
| Embeddings | $0 | local gte-small, no cloud API |
| LLMs (P2+) | ~$5–15 | Haiku + Gemini Flash + (eventually) Kimi |
| **Total (P1)** | **~$0** | |
