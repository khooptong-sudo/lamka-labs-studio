"""APScheduler setup (Part II §4.3, §4.4, §4.6).

Key invariants:
  - AsyncIOScheduler + AsyncIOExecutor. Every job is `async def` (decision #22).
    `register_jobs` asserts `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(fn)` for each entry
    and fails at BOOT, naming the offending job id — a build-time guarantee,
    not a code-review hope.
  - Advisory lock around each job body (§4.6), EXCEPT db_health (decision #27) —
    gating the DB-health probe behind a lock that itself needs the DB is
    self-defeating.
  - Single-replica is enforced at deploy time (Railway replicas=1); the
    advisory lock is belt-and-suspenders for the rolling-redeploy overlap.
