"""Coarse progress for a generation run.

Deliberately coarse: one row updated at stage boundaries, polled by the GUI
every couple of seconds. A finer-grained channel — websockets, per-frame
events — would be more infrastructure than a six-stage pipeline needs, and the
thing a human actually wants to know is "which stage, and did it fail".

`STAGES` is ordered and the GUI renders its progress bar from that ordering, so
inserting a stage in the middle is a deliberate, breaking change rather than an
append-anywhere list.
