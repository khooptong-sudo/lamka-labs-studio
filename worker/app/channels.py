"""Per-channel configuration.

One engine serves more than one YouTube channel. A channel supplies the voice
and the script prompt; it does not supply the compliance rules. Those are the
constants below, and a channel can only add to the blocklist, never remove from
it, so there is no config edit or GUI control that can switch compliance off.

Config lives in the `config` table under the key `channels`. Read it through
`resolve()`, which validates once and returns a frozen object. Nothing else
should interpret the raw dict.
